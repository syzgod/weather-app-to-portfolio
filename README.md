# Yet another Weather App

## Description

As for my first bigger React project I chose the Weather app to properly learn and implement what I have learned. React using Hooks and TypeScript with API are the latest technologies used most of the places so it is wise to get familiar with them. I wanted a challenge to help me understand how these technologies work. Had few bugs then introduced more as I added more features so I had plenty of debugging as a good exercise. The app itself is not perfect in fact far from it. I tried my best. There are a lot of improvements can be made. I chose to implement a basic chart also so I can play around with the data a bit more. I have to say I learned a lot from this project and I am more eager to start new projects.

## Inspired by few of the tutorials found online

### Technologies used:

### Things I learned:
- How to work with React, React components using Props and State
- How to use Tailwind CSS to create beautiful UI along with JSX to create conditional CSS classes
- How to use API and fetch
- How to add functionalities to the page so it can display conditionally so as display based on API call and response
- How to use TypeScript
- A basic integration of a Chart using Rechart

### Challenges during building the project:
- API itself is challenging enough when comes to handling data
- React Props, States and Hooks through components




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
